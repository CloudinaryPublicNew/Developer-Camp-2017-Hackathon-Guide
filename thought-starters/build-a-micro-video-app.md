With the exploding popularity of micro video platforms like Vine and Instagram video; These micro videos are becoming increasingly popular, user will have the need to create native content between 2-15 seconds to be successful on these platforms.

Could you build a better app?  

Cloudinary's [video uploade](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_videos)r and [video APIs](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/video_manipulation_and_delivery) allow you to create and manipulate video on the fly simply by adding a few parameters to the url:

### Choose a Serverless Stack

Resist the urge to create an express app and deploy a server for this one!  Instead, focus on using each API directly within a Single Page App \(SPA\) to take advantage of the responsive design possibilities.

Cloudinary's APIs work elegantly with Auth0 [Webtasks](https://webtask.io) and other serverless platforms.  We support many languages, including JavaScript and [Node.js](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration).

### Use This Guide to Get Started

We've organized the Cloudinary resources in this guide by functionality so you can quickly add a feature to your application. Each article is a short and concise walkthrough, so you won't have to comb too deep through our extensive [documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation), unless you want to.

### Tweet/Share your Experience

We know your Hackathon experience will be fun and engaging.  Don't forget to share that with your friends on social media.   _**In fact, we've added links at the top of this guide to make sharing easy.**_. Learning about visualizing an audio waveform? Show the world what you are working on and let them learn about these cool technologies, right along with you.

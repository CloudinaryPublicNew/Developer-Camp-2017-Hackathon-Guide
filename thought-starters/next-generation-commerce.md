#Next Generation Ecommerce: 
![](http://res.cloudinary.com/de-demo/image/upload/c_scale,w_800/v1510419060/vr-next-gen.jpg)

Build a service for ecommerce-based websites and platforms. These platforms should be able to use your service to provide [beautifully made widgets](https://cloudydesk.com/face/) that allow users to [upload photos of themselves and match product items](https://scotch.io/tutorials/overlay-glassesmasks-on-avatars-with-vuejs-and-cloudinary) such as hats, eyeglasses, ear rings, e.t.c to these pictures. 

Overlaying product items on personal photos give the users an option to quickly check if these items are a great fit for them. In addition, your service will automatically provide a better user experience which in turn yields user conversions.

### Choose a Serverless Stack

Resist the urge to create an express app and deploy a server for this one!  Instead, focus on using each API directly within a Single Page App \(SPA\) to take advantage of the responsive design possibilities.

Cloudinary's APIs work elegantly with Auth0 [Webtasks](https://webtask.io) and other serverless platforms.  We support many languages, including JavaScript and [Node.js](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration).

### Use This Guide to Get Started

We've organized the Cloudinary resources in this guide by functionality so you can quickly add a feature to your application. Each article is a short and concise walkthrough, so you won't have to comb too deep through our extensive [documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation), unless you want to.

### Tweet/Share your Experience

We know your Hackathon experience will be fun and engaging.  Don't forget to share that with your friends on social media.   _**In fact, we've added links at the top of this guide to make sharing easy.**_. Learning about visualizing an audio waveform? Show the world what you are working on and let them learn about these cool technologies, right along with you.
